# CAL - CODE AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE - USED TO TALK TO ROBOT, MACHINE, AND CLOUD AI IDE.
 CODE AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE - CAL : Code Automatic Language under development by CODING ROBOTICS will be used to talk to the robot to create apps for IOS, ANDROID and WINDOWS.  CAL will be unveiled for developers to develop their dream projects very soon. You will be working with Real Robot, Machine, or Cloud based AI to develop projects. CAL here to change the existing IDEs like Visual Studio, Andriod Studio, Xcode in the world today. Ready to step into Robotic Era. 
 
 CAL could be used to program in C, C++, C#, Objective C, Java, PHP, Python, Javascript,HTML,CSS SQL, MySQl, No-SQL, Game Programming, Machine Learning Projects, and Artificial Intelligence Projects.

 EXAMPLES OF CAL QUERIES:
 
 1. To Create a Database:
 
 We used to type a command in CMD or SHELL to create database in real world. When it comes to CAL you just say the word to the ROBOT, it will do the remaining part for you.
 
 CREATE "NAME" DATABASE "NO OF" INSTANCE
 
 CREATE "MYSQL" DATABASE "1" INSTANCE
 
 
 2. To Backup a Database:
 
 You can ask the ROBOT IDE to take a dump of database and also tell the robot to do next steps like, save it in D:/ Drive or SEND TO CLOUD ACCOUNT.
 
 TAKE DUMP OF "NAME" DATABASE AND SEND TO "CLOUD" ACCOUNT
 
 TAKE DUMP OF "ABC.COM" DATABASE AND SEND TO "ABC CLOUD" ACCOUNT
 
 
 3. To Create an APP:
 
 You can ask the robot to create an app with prebuilt templates for your ecosystem (IOS, ANDROID, and WINDOWS), or proceed with a blank or custom template.
 
 CREATE "CATEGORY" APP FOR "ECOSYSTEM" USING "LANGUAGE STACK"
 
 CREATE "SHOPPING" APP FOR "IOS" USING "OBJECTIV C"
